# Next.js Template

A Next.js starter kit for my personal projects.

## Rationale

I recently found myself creating a lot of Next.js projects for various reasons, and I was getting tired of going through the same steps (installing the tailwind template, adding typescript, etc...) over and over again. So, to speed up that process, I made this template that includes the base configuration and tools for future projects.
